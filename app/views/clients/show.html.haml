/ I added columns for the programs and trainers on my client index and show pages.  I couldn't figure out how to display the program that the client has chosen when they fill out the form (add client).  I was hoping to get that on the show page.  
  / upated "back" link on show page to go back to clients_path rather than to root_path
  / updated "back" link on index to go back to welcome page
  / changed date of birth format on show page to be M/D/Yrs
